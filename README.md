Wrapper to call Linux CLI program from Wine

First milestone is to make GitExtensions runing in Wine to successfully use Linux native Git.

It is licensed under GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2.1 or any later at your option so it can be included with Wine or GitExtensions in future.

This project is abandoned. It never delivered its promises. It inspired another project to solve the problem using different means: https://github.com/monoblaine/wine_git
